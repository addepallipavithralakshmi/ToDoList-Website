# ToDoList-Website
A full-stack To-Do List app built using the MERN stack. The frontend uses React for an interactive UI, while ExpressJS and Node.js handle the backend API. Tasks are stored in MongoDB, allowing users to add, update, and delete items in real time with a clean, responsive interface.
